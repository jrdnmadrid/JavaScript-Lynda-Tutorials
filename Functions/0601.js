//This is the "Basic Functions" video tutorial from the "Introducing the JavaScript Language" series. 

//You could copy these statements over again, but it would be tedious if you had to modify each one. That's where functions come in.
console.log('Arf');
console.log('Woof');
console.log('Meow');
console.log('Mooooooo'); 

//let's make a function.

function speak() {
    console.log('Arf');
    console.log('Woof');
    console.log('Meow');
    console.log('Moooooo');
}

//now, we can use the speak() function to call all four sounds.
