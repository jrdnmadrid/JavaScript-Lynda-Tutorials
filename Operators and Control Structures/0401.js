//This is the "Simple Comparisons" video tutorial from the "Introducing the JavaScript Language" series. 

//this operator sees if the left is equal to the right. 
1 === 1;

//If you replace the first equal sign with a !, it means not equal to. 
1 !== 1; //false

1 !== 2; //true

1 === 2; //false

//With two equal signs, it means pretty close to the same.

1 == 1; //true

//The difference between === and == is that == will accept strings (1 == '1') is true while 1 === '1' is false. 
1 === '1'; //false
1 == '1'; //true

//there are other operators as well: 
1 < 2; //true
1 > 2;  //false
1 <= 2; //true
1 <= 1;  //true
1 >= 2;//false
10 >= 2; //true
