//This is the "Readability: Comments" video tutorial from the "Introducing the JavaScript Language" series. 

//there are two types of comments, the line comment does not execute and can be used for describing code or disabling it (see day).

var year = 2012,
    month = 'October', 
    //day = 31,
    holiday = 'Halloween';

var tinyAlmanac = {
    'year': 2012,
    'month': 'October',
    'day': 31,
    'holiday': 'Halloween'
};

/*You can also use the block comment, 
which allows you to use multiple lines. 

You can also comment out all your lines of code with block commenting as well.*/
